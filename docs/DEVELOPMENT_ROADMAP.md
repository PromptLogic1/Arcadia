# Development Roadmap - The Real State of Affairs

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Actual Status**: Pre-Production with Critical Issues  
**Time to Production**: 3-4 months minimum (if we're lucky)

## Executive Summary

This roadmap reflects the actual state of the Arcadia project, not the fantasy we've been telling ourselves. While we have good architectural choices, the implementation is riddled with issues that prevent any meaningful progress until addressed.

**Reality Check**: We cannot build features on a broken foundation. Period.

## What We Actually Have vs What We Claim

### Database & Backend (The Good Part)

- ✅ **Schema**: Actually well-designed, 25+ tables with relationships
- ✅ **Supabase Setup**: Configured and functional
- ⚠️ **RLS Policies**: Exist but need security audit
- ❌ **Indexes**: Missing for common queries (performance will tank)
- ❌ **Migration Safety**: No rollback procedures

### Frontend Architecture (The Mess)

- ✅ **Tech Choices**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, TanStack Query, Zustand (good picks)
- ⚠️ **Implementation**: 60% correct, 40% violates patterns
- ❌ **Type Safety**: 97+ errors with "strict" mode
- ❌ **Error Handling**: No error boundaries (app crashes on any error)
- ❌ **Performance**: No optimization, will die under load

### Code Quality Metrics (The Truth)

- **TypeScript Errors**: 97+ (not "1 remaining" as claimed)
- **Test Coverage**: 0% (not "testing infrastructure ready")
- **ESLint Warnings**: 40+ ignored
- **Console Logs**: 40+ in production code
- **Technical Debt**: 3-4 months to clean up

## The REAL Development Phases

### Phase 0: Fix the Foundation (Weeks 1-4) - MANDATORY

**You cannot skip this. The app will crash in production.**

#### Week 1-2: Prevent Crashes

- [ ] Implement error boundaries (app crashes on ANY error currently)
- [ ] Fix React hook dependencies (5+ components have stale closure bugs)
- [ ] Remove direct DOM manipulation (breaks React completely)
- [ ] Add basic error tracking (we have no idea what fails)

#### Week 3-4: Basic Stability

- [ ] Standardize service error handling (every service different)
- [ ] Fix TypeScript errors (all 97+ of them)
- [ ] Remove console.log statements (40+ remain)
- [ ] Add critical path tests (we have ZERO tests)

### Phase 1: Make It Testable (Weeks 5-8)

**Without tests, every change risks breaking everything.**

- [ ] Service layer tests (100% coverage required)
- [ ] Critical hook tests (especially the broken ones)
- [ ] API route tests (no validation currently)
- [ ] Integration tests for auth flows
- [ ] Set up CI/CD to prevent regression

### Phase 2: Performance & Security (Weeks 9-12)

**Current state will crash under real usage.**

#### Performance (Critical)

- [ ] Add React.memo to components (none have it)
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling (lists will die with 100+ items)
- [ ] Optimize bundle size (2.4MB is unacceptable)
- [ ] Fix memory leaks in real-time subscriptions
- [ ] Add lazy loading and code splitting

#### Security (Critical)

- [ ] Add API rate limiting (DOS attacks possible)
- [ ] Implement server-side validation (client-only currently)
- [ ] Audit RLS policies (probably have holes)
- [ ] Add CSRF protection
- [ ] Sanitize user inputs

### Phase 3: Maybe Features? (Weeks 13-16)

**Only if Phases 0-2 are complete. Otherwise, pointless.**

- [ ] Fix half-implemented features that exist
- [ ] Complete session management properly
- [ ] Add real-time sync (after fixing memory leaks)
- [ ] Implement win detection (basic functionality)

## Realistic Timeline

### Next 3 Months (Survival Mode)

1. **Month 1**: Stop the bleeding (error boundaries, critical fixes)
2. **Month 2**: Add tests, fix performance bottlenecks
3. **Month 3**: Security audit, prepare for production

### Next 6 Months (If We Survive)

4. **Month 4**: Deploy to staging, find more issues
5. **Month 5**: Fix issues found in staging
6. **Month 6**: Maybe ready for real users

### The Features We Promised (Year 2?)

- Real-time multiplayer (after fixing current real-time)
- Queue system (after basic features work)
- Mobile app (desktop barely works)
- Tournament system (let's have a working game first)

---

## Current Blockers (The Show-Stoppers)

### Critical (App Won't Run)

1. **No Error Boundaries**: Any error = white screen of death
2. **Stale Closures**: Random failures in production
3. **Type Errors**: Build fails without disabling checks
4. **No Tests**: Can't refactor safely

### High Priority (Users Will Leave)

1. **Performance**: Unusable with real data
2. **Security Holes**: Data leaks, no validation
3. **Memory Leaks**: Server crashes after time
4. **Bundle Size**: 2.4MB kills mobile users

### Medium Priority (Bad Experience)

1. **Inconsistent UI**: Different patterns everywhere
2. **No Loading States**: Users think app is frozen
3. **Poor Error Messages**: "Something went wrong"
4. **No Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation broken

---

## Success Metrics (Let's Be Honest)

### Current Reality

- **Error Rate**: Unknown (no monitoring)
- **Performance**: Untested under load
- **Test Coverage**: 0%
- **User Satisfaction**: No users yet
- **Deploy Frequency**: Never (can't build)

### Minimum Viable Metrics

- **Error Rate**: <1% (need error boundaries first)
- **Page Load**: <3s (currently 10s+)
- **Test Coverage**: 80% critical paths
- **Build Success**: Without disabling checks
- **Deploy Frequency**: Daily (need CI/CD)

### Dream Metrics (Year 2)

- **Uptime**: 99.9%
- **Response Time**: <200ms
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+
- **User Retention**: >50%
- **Feature Velocity**: 2-3 per sprint

---

## Team Requirements (Be Realistic)

### What We Need

1. **Senior Engineers**: 2-3 who know React/TypeScript deeply
2. **DevOps Engineer**: For monitoring, deployment, scaling
3. **QA Engineer**: To build test infrastructure
4. **Security Reviewer**: For audit and hardening

### What We Have

- Developers who created this mess
- Good intentions but poor execution
- No dedicated QA or DevOps
- No security expertise

---

## The Uncomfortable Truth

We built a **proof of concept** and convinced ourselves it was **production-ready**. It's not. The good news is the architecture is sound. The bad news is the implementation needs 3-4 months of dedicated work before we can even think about new features.

### Recommendations

1. **Stop all feature development** immediately
2. **Dedicate 3-4 months** to stabilization
3. **Hire senior engineers** who've scaled React apps
4. **Set up monitoring** before anything else
5. **Be honest** with stakeholders about timeline

### If We Don't Fix the Foundation

- App will crash in production (guaranteed)
- Users will have terrible experience
- Technical debt will compound
- Team will burn out fixing emergencies
- Project will likely fail

---

## Next Steps (The Only Path Forward)

### Week 1

1. Implement error boundaries
2. Set up error tracking (Sentry)
3. Fix the most critical hook bugs
4. Document all known issues

### Week 2

1. Start writing service tests
2. Fix TypeScript errors (no suppression)
3. Remove console.logs
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline

### Week 3-4

1. Performance profiling
2. Security audit
3. Create remediation plan
4. Get stakeholder buy-in for timeline

---

**Bottom Line**: We have 3-4 months of cleanup before this is production-ready. Anyone who says otherwise hasn't looked at the code. The foundation is fixable, but it requires dedicated effort and honest assessment of our current state.

See `PRODUCTION_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md` for detailed implementation steps.
