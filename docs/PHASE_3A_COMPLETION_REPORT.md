## 📊 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Database Seeding Architecture**

```typescript
// Comprehensive demo board creation with proper typing
const DEMO_BOARDS = [
  {
    title: 'World of Warcraft: Classic Nostalgia',
    description: 'Relive the golden age of Azeroth with iconic WoW moments',
    game_type: 'World of Warcraft',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    cells: [
      /* 25 engaging, nostalgic challenges */
    ],
  },
  // ... more boards
];
```

### **Smart Session Management**

```typescript
// Try to join existing sessions before creating new ones
const joinRandomSession = async () => {
  for (const board of DEMO_BOARDS) {
    const sessions = await fetch(
      `/api/bingo/sessions?boardId=${board.id}&status=waiting`
    );
    if (sessions.length > 0) {
      // Join existing session
      return joinExistingSession(sessions[0]);
    }
  }
  // Create new session if none available
  return createNewSession(randomBoard);
};
```

### **User Experience Flow**

```
Landing Page → Try Demo Game → Select Board → Auto-Generate Name → Create/Join Session → Start Playing
     ↓                ↓              ↓                ↓                    ↓
