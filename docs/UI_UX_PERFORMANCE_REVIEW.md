- Created ThemeWrapper component to handle client-side mounting
- Fixed scroll state initialization timing
- Used cn() utility for consistent className handling
- **Result**: Eliminated SSR/CSR hydration errors

### 3. Next.js App Router Optimization âœ…

- Fixed metadata export issues with client components
- Created proper layout.tsx for play-area route
- Restructured page components to separate server/client boundaries
- **Result**: Proper metadata handling and improved SEO

### 4. Performance Optimization Round 1 âœ… (NEW)

- **Bundle Size Optimization**: Confirmed no usage of heavy react-icons package (already optimized)
- **Dynamic Imports**: Implemented lazy loading for BingoGrid, PlayAreaHub, and all landing page sections
- **Critical CSS**: Enhanced critical.css with comprehensive base styles, container utilities, and skeleton loaders
- **Scroll Performance**: Added throttling (50ms) to Header scroll handlers with passive listeners
- **Animation Optimization**: Added mobile detection to disable heavy animations on devices â‰¤768px width
- **Prefers-reduced-motion**: Full support for accessibility motion preferences
- **Result**: Reduced initial bundle size, improved mobile performance, better accessibility

### 5. Image Optimization âœ… (NEW)

- **Next.js Image Migration**: Confirmed all images use OptimizedImage wrapper with proper optimization
- **Blur Placeholders**: Created image-utils.ts with game-specific blur data URLs for hero images
- **Performance**: Added blur placeholders to FeaturedGamesCarousel and Avatar components
- **Responsive Images**: Proper sizing hints and lazy loading already implemented
- **Result**: Faster image loading with smooth transitions and reduced CLS

### 6. Mobile Accessibility âœ… (NEW)

- **Touch Targets**: Fixed dialog close buttons, header icons, and mobile menu toggle to meet 44x44px minimum
- **CSS Utilities**: Added .touch-target and .icon-button-touch utility classes
- **Animation Control**: Mobile devices now automatically disable heavy animations for better performance
- **Responsive Design**: Enhanced mobile-first approach with proper viewport considerations
- **Result**: Improved mobile usability and accessibility compliance

## Remaining Performance Issues

### 1. Bundle Analysis ðŸŸ¡ (Updated Priority)

- **Current**: Bundle size optimization in progress
- **Issues**:
  - Need webpack-bundle-analyzer to identify remaining large dependencies
  - Potential for further code splitting optimization
  - Tree-shaking verification needed
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Run comprehensive bundle analysis with webpack-bundle-analyzer
  - [ ] Identify and optimize any remaining large dependencies
  - [ ] Implement route-based code splitting for rarely visited pages

### 2. Accessibility Enhancements ðŸŸ¡

- **Progress**: Touch targets fixed, animation preferences supported
- **Remaining Issues**:
  - Color contrast ratios need audit in cyberpunk theme
  - Some interactive components still missing ARIA labels
  - Keyboard navigation could be improved in complex components
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Comprehensive color contrast audit using accessibility tools
  - [ ] Add ARIA labels to remaining interactive components
  - [ ] Test and enhance keyboard navigation patterns

### 3. Font Loading Strategy ðŸŸ¡

- **Issues**:
  - Font loading could be further optimized
  - Potential for font-display optimization
  - Web font preloading strategy
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Implement font-display: swap consistently
  - [ ] Add preload hints for critical fonts
  - [ ] Consider font subsetting for better performance

### 4. Advanced Performance Monitoring ðŸŸ¡

- **Current**: Web Vitals already integrated
- **Enhancement Opportunities**:
  - Real User Monitoring (RUM) could be expanded
  - Performance budgets and alerts
  - Advanced Core Web Vitals optimization
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Set up performance budgets in CI/CD
  - [ ] Implement advanced Web Vitals tracking
  - [ ] Add performance regression detection

### 5. SEO and Social Optimization ðŸŸ¡

- **Issues**:
  - Meta tags could be enhanced
  - Open Graph images and social sharing
  - Structured data implementation
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Enhance meta tags for better SEO
  - [ ] Add Open Graph and Twitter Card support
  - [ ] Implement structured data for gaming content

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. Implement bundle splitting and tree shaking
2. Replace react-icons with optimized SVG imports
3. Add performance monitoring (Web Vitals already integrated)

### Short-term (Week 2-3)

1. Migrate to next/image for all images
2. Implement critical CSS extraction
3. Add intersection observer for lazy loading

### Long-term (Month 1-2)

1. Consider switching to CSS-only animations where possible
2. Implement service worker for offline support
3. Add progressive enhancement for low-end devices

## Performance Metrics Targets

- **LCP**: < 2.5s (estimated improvement: ~2s with optimizations)
- **FID**: < 100ms (mobile performance enhanced with animation controls)
- **CLS**: < 0.1 (improved with image blur placeholders and critical CSS)
- **Bundle Size**: Optimization in progress (dynamic imports implemented)

## Conclusion

**Significant progress achieved**: Type safety, hydration issues, and major performance bottlenecks have been resolved. The codebase now features:

âœ… **Comprehensive performance optimizations** with dynamic imports and critical CSS
âœ… **Mobile-first accessibility** with proper touch targets and animation controls  
âœ… **Advanced image optimization** with blur placeholders and responsive loading
âœ… **Production-ready architecture** with proper error boundaries and monitoring

**Next phase focus**: Bundle analysis, accessibility audit, and advanced performance monitoring to achieve production-ready standards. The foundation is now solid for scaling to production.
