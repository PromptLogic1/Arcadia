# 📚 Arcadia Historical Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation for understanding project evolution. Most historical phase and migration documents have been archived as they are no longer relevant to the current project state.

_Last Updated: 2025-01-06 | Status: Cleaned_

## 📁 Current Historical Documents

### 🔄 **Active Migration Documentation** (`/migrations/`)

- [`ARC_CLEANUP.md`](./migrations/ARC_CLEANUP.md) - Architecture cleanup warnings and patterns to avoid

## ⚠️ Note on Historical Accuracy

Many historical documents contained outdated or incorrect information about the project state. The following have been removed:

- Phase completion reports (claimed features that weren't actually complete)
- Migration reports (contained future dates and incorrect status)
- Theme implementation details (no longer relevant)
- Redundant cleanup reports

For current project status, please refer to:

- `/docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Accurate current state
- `/docs/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` - Realistic timeline
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Critical instructions and reality check
