### Arcadia Community Feature Log

#### Session: Initial Refactoring Pass (Community Components)

**File(s) Processed:**

- `src/features/community/components/Community.tsx`
- `src/features/community/hooks/useCommunityData.ts`
- `src/features/community/hooks/useCommunityVirtualization.ts`
- `src/features/community/components/CommunityFilters.tsx`

**Kurzbeschreibung der Änderung (Design, Struktur, Typen):**

- **`useCommunityData.ts`**:

  - Refined `CommentFormData` to only include `content`. `author_id`, `discussion_id`, and `upvotes` are now set internally in `handleComment`, improving data contract clarity and type safety for form submissions.
  - Corrected an import path for mock constants from `@/features/community/shared/constants` to `@/features/community/constants` to resolve a module not found error.

- **`useCommunityVirtualization.ts`**:

  - Modified the hook to create and return two separate `parentRef` objects (`discussionsContainerRef`, `eventsContainerRef`) for the discussions and events lists, respectively.
  - This change ensures that each virtualized list correctly refers to its own scrollable container DOM element, fixing a potential bug where both lists might inadvertently share or overwrite the same ref, leading to incorrect virtualization behavior.
  - Ensured the return type for these refs is `React.RefObject<HTMLDivElement | null>`, which accurately reflects a ref initialized with `null` that will hold an `HTMLDivElement`.

- **`src/features/community/components/Community.tsx`** (Main community component):

  - Updated to correctly destructure and utilize the new separate `discussionsContainerRef` and `eventsContainerRef` from the `useCommunityVirtualization` hook.
  - Ensured that `DiscussionsList` receives `discussionsContainerRef` and `EventsList` receives `eventsContainerRef` for their respective `parentRef` props.
  - Corrected import paths for `ErrorBoundary` and `SearchInput` components from an incorrect `../shared/` path to direct relative sibling paths (e.g., `./ErrorBoundary`), resolving module path issues.
  - The `isLoading` prop passed to `DiscussionsList` and `EventsList` was updated to be a composite of the specific section's loading state (e.g., `isDiscussionsLoading`) and the general `loading` state from `useCommunityData` for a more comprehensive loading indication.

- **`src/features/community/components/CommunityFilters.tsx`**:
  - Corrected the import path for the `SearchInput` component to a relative sibling path (`./SearchInput`) instead of an incorrect alias path.
  - Corrected the import path for `GAMES` and `CHALLENGE_TYPES` constants to point to the centralized `@/features/community/constants` file.

**Erwähnte Abhängigkeiten (Key Libraries/Components):**

- `@tanstack/react-virtual`: Core library for list virtualization.
- Zustand (`@/lib/stores/community-store`): For global state management of community data.
- `lucide-react`: Icon library.
- `@/components/ui/*`: Project-specific UI components (e.g., `Skeleton`, `NeonButton`, `Select`, `ToggleGroup`), assumed to be based on shadcn/ui principles.
- Custom Hooks: `useCommunityData`, `useCommunityFilters`, `useCommunityVirtualization` for logic separation.
- Feature Components: `CommunityHeader`, `CommunityFilters`, `DiscussionsList`, `EventsList`, `DiscussionCard`, `EventCard`, `CreateDiscussionForm`, `ErrorBoundary`, `SearchInput`.

**Status:**

- ✅ Ready for review

#### Session: Community Routes & Pages

**File(s) Processed:**

- `src/app/community/page.tsx`
- `src/app/api/discussions/route.ts`

**Kurzbeschreibung der Änderung (Design, Struktur, Typen):**

- **`src/app/community/page.tsx`**:

  - Verified import paths for `LoadingSpinner` and `Community` components against `tsconfig.json` path aliases, ensuring they are correct.
  - Refined the import path for the `Community` component from ` '@/src/features/...'` to `'@/features/...'` for improved consistency with defined path alias conventions (`@/features/*`).
  - Confirmed the existing `LoadingSpinner` component (from `@/components/ui/loading-spinner`) is well-structured, uses `cva` for variants, includes accessibility attributes, and is suitable for use as a `Suspense` fallback.
  - Validated that the Next.js specific configurations (`export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';`, `export const revalidate = 30;`) are appropriate for a frequently updated community page.

- **`src/app/api/discussions/route.ts`** (API Route Handler):
  - Reviewed GET and POST request handlers responsible for fetching and creating discussions via Supabase.
  - Updated the `DiscussionPostBody` TypeScript interface by removing the `category` field. This field was defined in the type but was not being utilized in the Supabase database insert operation within the POST handler. This change aligns the data contract with its actual usage, enhancing type safety and clarity.
  - Verified overall structure including error handling (try-catch blocks, specific error logging), Supabase client usage (`createServerComponentClient`), data shaping for GET requests (including nested author and comment details), and consistent logging practices with metadata.

**Erwähnte Abhängigkeiten (Key Libraries/Components):**

- `@/lib/supabase` (specifically `createServerComponentClient`)
- `next/server` (for `NextResponse`, `Request` types in API routes)
- `@/lib/logger` (for server-side logging)
- Supabase SDK (for database interactions)
- `@/components/ui/loading-spinner`
- `@/features/community/components/Community`

**Status:**

- ✅ Ready for review

#### Session: Troubleshooting EventCard Module Not Found & Type Errors

**File(s) Processed:**

- `src/features/community/components/EventCard.tsx`
- `src/features/community/components/shared/CardWrapper.tsx`

**Kurzbeschreibung der Änderung (Design, Struktur, Typen):**

- **Troubleshooting Build Error**: Addressed a "Module not found: Can't resolve '../shared/CardWrapper'" error that occurred during `npm run dev`, originating from `EventCard.tsx`.

- **`EventCard.tsx`**:

  - Corrected the import path for the `CardWrapper` component from `../shared/CardWrapper` to the correct relative path `./shared/CardWrapper`, resolving the module not found error.
  - Corrected the import for the `Event` type. It was previously importing a local (and differing) `Event` type definition from `../types/types.ts`. The import was changed to `import type { Event } from '@/lib/stores/community-store';` to align with the `Event` type used in the application's data flow (originating from the Zustand store) and ensure type consistency.

- **`src/features/community/components/shared/CardWrapper.tsx`**:
  - To resolve a subsequent TypeScript error in `EventCard.tsx` (Property 'onClick' does not exist on type 'CardWrapperProps'), the `CardWrapperProps` interface was updated.
  - Added an optional `onClick?: () => void;` prop to allow the card to be clickable.
  - Added an optional `hoverAccentColor?: string;` prop (the error also mentioned this prop was missing, though the exact error message for this wasn't fully captured in the prompt, it was inferred from context and common patterns).
  - The `onClick` handler is now passed to the underlying `Card` component from `@/components/ui/card`, enabling click functionality for the wrapped content.

**Erwähnte Abhängigkeiten (Key Libraries/Components):**

- `@/lib/stores/community-store` (for the canonical `Event` type)
- `@/components/ui/card` (base `Card` component used by `CardWrapper`)

**Status:**

- ✅ Module not found and related type errors addressed. Ready for review.

#### Session: Deep Analysis & Data Flow Integration (Community)

**File(s) Processed:**

- `src/features/community/types/types.ts`
- `src/features/community/hooks/useEvents.ts`
- `src/features/community/hooks/useSearch.ts`
- `src/features/community/components/CommunityHeader.tsx`
- `src/features/community/hooks/useDiscussions.ts`
- `src/features/community/hooks/useCommunityData.ts`

**Kurzbeschreibung der Änderung (Design, Struktur, Typen):**

- **`src/features/community/types/types.ts`**:

  - Removed the unused `hoverAccentColor` prop from `CardWrapperProps` for type accuracy.
  - Updated the `Event` interface to be more comprehensive, including `maxParticipants`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and made `participants` non-readonly to align better with store types and `MOCK_EVENTS` data.

- **`src/features/community/hooks/useEvents.ts`**:

  - Corrected the import path for `MOCK_EVENTS` from `../shared/constants` to `../constants`.

- **`src/features/community/hooks/useSearch.ts`**:

  - Updated the `matchesChallenge` logic to correctly check for `challenge_type` (snake_case) on items when filtering, consistent with the `Discussion` type.

- **`src/features/community/components/CommunityHeader.tsx`**:

  - Enhanced the decorative divider: the central dot was made slightly larger (`h-2.5 w-2.5`) and a subtle pulse animation (`animate-pulse duration-1000`) was added for visual appeal.

- **`src/features/community/hooks/useDiscussions.ts`**:

  - Exported `Discussion`, `Comment`, and `UseDiscussionsReturn` interfaces to make them available for import by other modules (specifically `useCommunityData.ts`).
  - Adjusted `Omit` types in the function signatures for `addDiscussion` and `addComment`. `author_id` is now correctly omitted from the input `discussionData` type for `addDiscussion`, and `author_id` & `discussion_id` from the input `commentData` for `addComment`, as these are handled internally by the hook.

- **`src/features/community/hooks/useCommunityData.ts`**:
  - Major refactor to integrate `useDiscussions.ts` for fetching and managing discussion and comment data.
  - Removed mock discussion data initialization and direct Zustand actions for setting mock discussions.
  - Discussion and comment data, loading states, error states, and CRUD operations (`handleCreateDiscussion`, `handleUpvote`, `handleComment`) are now primarily sourced from or delegated to `useDiscussions`.
  - Mock data and Zustand management for `events` are retained as `useEvents` still uses mock data.
  - Types for discussions and comments now align with those exported by `useDiscussions`.
  - Corrected type incompatibilities for `challenge_type` and `tags` when calling `realAddDiscussion` by ensuring `undefined` values from `CreateDiscussionFormData` are converted to `null`.

**Erwähnte Abhängigkeiten (Key Libraries/Components):**

- `useDiscussions.ts` (now a core dependency for `useCommunityData.ts`)
- All previously mentioned dependencies for the community feature.

**Status:**

- ✅ Data flow for discussions integrated with backend hook. Visual enhancement applied. Type issues addressed. Ready for review.
