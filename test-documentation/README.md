## 🎯 Testing Strategy

### Priority Levels
1. **Critical** - Core functionality that blocks user progress
2. **High** - Features affecting user experience and retention
3. **Medium** - Nice-to-have features and edge cases
4. **Low** - Cosmetic issues and minor optimizations

### Test Types
- **Smoke Tests** - Basic functionality verification
- **Regression Tests** - Ensure fixes don't break existing features
- **Integration Tests** - Cross-feature interactions
- **Performance Tests** - Load time and resource usage
- **Security Tests** - Vulnerability scanning
- **Accessibility Tests** - WCAG compliance

## 🚀 Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Test Organization
```typescript
// Group related tests
test.describe('Feature Name', () => {
  // Use beforeEach for common setup
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/feature');
  });

  // Clear, descriptive test names
  test('should perform specific action', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### 2. Best Practices
- Use semantic locators (`getByRole`, `getByLabel`)
- Implement Page Object Model for complex features
- Add proper waits for dynamic content
- Keep tests independent and idempotent
- Use test data factories for consistency
- Clean up test data after execution

### 3. Performance Targets
- Initial page load: < 3 seconds
- API responses: < 500ms
- Interactive elements: < 100ms response
- Bundle size: < 500KB initial load

### 4. Coverage Goals
- Critical paths: 100% coverage
- Happy paths: 90% coverage
- Edge cases: 70% coverage
- Error scenarios: 80% coverage

## 📊 Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
1. Test execution time
2. Flakiness rate
3. Coverage percentage
4. Performance benchmarks
5. Accessibility score
6. Security vulnerabilities

### CI/CD Integration
- Run smoke tests on every commit
- Full test suite on PR merges
- Performance tests nightly
- Security scans weekly
- Visual regression on UI changes

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Phase 1** - Implement critical path tests
2. **Phase 2** - Add comprehensive feature tests
3. **Phase 3** - Performance and security hardening
4. **Phase 4** - Visual regression and accessibility
5. **Phase 5** - Continuous monitoring and optimization

## 📝 Contributing

When adding new test cases:
1. Document in the appropriate section
2. Include rationale and expected outcomes
3. Add code examples where helpful
4. Update priority and coverage metrics
5. Review with team before implementation
