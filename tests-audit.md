## Critical Test Fixes Completed

### ✅ **Settings Service (24/24 tests passing)**

**Issue**: Auth ID fallback test failing - expected 2 calls to `from()` but only got 1
**Fix**: Properly mocked sequential Supabase calls using `mockReturnValueOnce()` pattern

```typescript
// Fixed pattern for multiple sequential calls
mockSupabase.from
  .mockReturnValueOnce(mockFrom)
  .mockReturnValueOnce(mockSecondFrom);
```

### ✅ **Submissions Service (16/16 tests passing)**

**Issue**: Filter application tests failing - query chaining not properly mocked
**Fix**: Created proper query chain mocks for dynamic filter application

```typescript
// Fixed pattern for query chaining with filters
const mockOrderResult = {
  eq: jest.fn().mockReturnValue({ data: [], error: null }),
};
mockFrom.order.mockReturnValue(mockOrderResult);
```

### ⚠️ **User Service (28/66 tests passing)**

**Issue**: Complex sequential database operations not properly mocked
**Partial Fix**: Fixed getUserStats with user_statistics table using sequential mock pattern
**Remaining**: 38 tests still need similar sequential mocking patterns for getUserActivities, avatar operations, follow system, etc.

## Established Mocking Patterns for Supabase Services

1. **Sequential calls**: Use `mockReturnValueOnce()` chaining
2. **Query filters**: Mock the query chain with proper intermediate objects
3. **Storage operations**: Mock both storage.from() and database operations
4. **Transform functions**: Mock the result transformation separately from database calls

These patterns should be applied to fix remaining user service tests and any future Supabase service test failures.
