# Play Area & Gaming Features Test Suite

## Overview

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for Arcadia's Play Area and Gaming Features, ensuring gameplay integrity, performance, and user experience across all gaming components.

## Test Files Structure

### Essential E2E Integration Test Suites
**Note**: Logic testing has been moved to comprehensive Jest unit tests in `src/features/play-area/test/` for improved performance and reliability.

1. **`game-hub.spec.ts`** - Complete game discovery user journey and UI integration
2. **`speedrun-precision.spec.ts`** - Browser timer precision testing under various conditions
3. **`game-discovery-performance.spec.ts`** - Real browser performance, memory usage, and virtualization

### Removed Tests (Now Covered by Jest Unit Tests)
**Logic Testing Migration**: Game logic and service testing moved to Jest for faster execution and better reliability.

- ❌ `game-session.spec.ts` → ✅ Play area service layer unit tests
- ❌ `speedruns.spec.ts` → ✅ `src/features/play-area/test/speedruns/speedrun-timer.test.ts`
- ❌ `achievements.spec.ts` → ✅ `src/features/play-area/test/achievements/achievement-engine.test.ts`
- ❌ `achievement-tracking.spec.ts` → ✅ `src/features/play-area/test/achievements/progress-tracker.test.ts`
- ❌ `game-filters.spec.ts` → ✅ `src/features/play-area/test/games/game-filters.test.ts`

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all play area tests
npx playwright test tests/features/play-area/

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/features/play-area/game-hub.spec.ts

# Performance testing
npx playwright test tests/features/play-area/ --grep "performance|load"

# Cross-platform testing
npx playwright test tests/features/play-area/ --project=chromium,firefox,webkit
```

## Key Features Tested

### ✅ Fully Implemented & Tested
- **Play Area Hub** - Session discovery with real-time updates
- **Game Session Management** - Multiplayer synchronization and state management
- **Game Timer System** - High-precision timing for speedruns

### 🚧 Partially Implemented
- **Speedrun System** - Timer components complete, anti-cheat validation in progress
- **Achievement System** - UI complete, server-side validation needed
- **Game Board System** - Basic functionality complete, advanced patterns needed

### Performance Benchmarks
- Game Hub: Load time < 3 seconds with 100+ sessions
- Session Join: Response time < 500ms
- Timer Accuracy: ±100ms tolerance over 10+ minutes
- Memory Usage: < 50MB growth over extended sessions
