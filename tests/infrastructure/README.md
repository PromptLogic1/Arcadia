- Cascading error handling
- Page-level error boundaries
- Error logging and reporting
- Development vs production error handling
- Performance impact assessment

**Key Scenarios Tested:**
- Component crashes don't break the whole app
- Error boundaries provide "Try Again" functionality
- Circuit breaker pattern for excessive errors
- Sentry integration for error reporting
- Error ID generation for tracking
- Memory leak prevention during error cycles

### 2. `network-failures.spec.ts`
**Network Failure and Recovery Testing**
- API timeout handling
- Request retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- HTTP status code handling (400, 401, 403, 404, 429, 500, 503)
- Offline state detection and management
- Slow network condition handling
- CORS error management
- Circuit breaker implementation
- Network recovery detection

**Key Scenarios Tested:**
- API returns 500 errors â†’ Shows user-friendly messages
- Network goes offline â†’ Queue actions for later sync
- Slow connections â†’ Display loading states
- Rate limiting â†’ Show "slow down" messages
- Recovery â†’ Resume normal operation seamlessly

### 3. `404-pages.spec.ts`
**404 and Error Page Functionality**
- Proper 404 page display for non-existent routes
- Navigation maintenance on error pages
- Helpful 404 content and suggestions
- Deep nested route handling
- Query parameter and hash fragment handling
- Accessibility compliance
- Dynamic route 404s vs data not found
- Performance optimization
- SEO meta data handling

**Key Scenarios Tested:**
- Invalid routes show proper 404 pages
- 404 pages maintain site navigation
- Accessibility standards compliance
- Search functionality on error pages
- Internationalization support
- Performance doesn't degrade

### 4. `api-errors.spec.ts`
**API Error Response Handling**
- HTTP status code specific handling
- Error message security (no sensitive data exposure)
- Contextual error messages
- Progressive error states
- Error logging for debugging
- Error persistence management
- Validation error display
- Authentication/authorization error handling

**Key Scenarios Tested:**
- API errors don't expose technical details
- Validation errors show specific field feedback
- Authentication errors redirect to login
- Server errors show generic messages with retry
- Rate limit errors show cooldown timers
- Error context preserved for debugging

### 5. `resilience.spec.ts`
**Application Resilience and Recovery**
- Component crash recovery without page reload
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- State recovery after temporary failures
- Memory management during failures
- Performance maintenance during errors
- User experience during recovery
- Data integrity protection
- Rollback mechanisms

**Key Scenarios Tested:**
- Components recover from crashes locally
- Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures
- Memory usage doesn't grow with error cycles
- User context preserved during failures
- Offline capabilities with cached content
- Data corruption prevention
- Atomic operations with rollback

## Test Utilities Used

The tests leverage utilities from `../helpers/test-utils.ts`:
- `mockApiResponse()` - Simulate API failures
- `waitForNetworkIdle()` - Ensure network requests complete
- `checkAccessibility()` - Basic accessibility validation
- `getPerformanceMetrics()` - Monitor performance impact
- `waitForAnimations()` - Handle UI transitions

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all infrastructure tests
npx playwright test tests/infrastructure/

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/infrastructure/error-boundaries.spec.ts

# Run with specific browser
npx playwright test tests/infrastructure/ --project=chromium

# Run in debug mode
npx playwright test tests/infrastructure/ --debug
```

## Test Coverage Focus

### Critical Resilience Scenarios
âœ… **Component crashes** - Isolated error boundaries prevent app crashes  
âœ… **Network failures** - Graceful degradation with user feedback  
âœ… **API errors** - User-friendly messages, no technical exposure  
âœ… **Offline functionality** - Queue actions, sync on reconnection  
âœ… **404 handling** - Proper navigation and helpful content  
âœ… **Memory management** - No leaks during error/recovery cycles  
âœ… **Performance** - Errors don't degrade app performance  
âœ… **Data integrity** - Atomic operations with rollback protection  

### User Experience Validation
âœ… **Error messages** - Clear, actionable, non-technical  
âœ… **Recovery options** - "Try Again", "Go Home", "Retry" buttons  
âœ… **Loading states** - Progress indicators during slow operations  
âœ… **Accessibility** - Error pages meet WCAG standards  
âœ… **Navigation** - Consistent navigation even during errors  
âœ… **Context preservation** - User state maintained through failures  

### Security Considerations
âœ… **Error sanitization** - No sensitive data in error messages  
âœ… **XSS prevention** - HTML/JS sanitization in error content  
âœ… **API security** - Internal error details not exposed  
âœ… **Logging safety** - No passwords/tokens in console logs  

## Expected Behavior

When these tests pass, the application demonstrates:

1. **Fault Tolerance**: Individual component failures don't crash the entire app
2. **User-Friendly Errors**: All error messages are understandable and actionable
3. **Network Resilience**: Handles offline states, timeouts, and API failures gracefully
4. **Performance Stability**: Error handling doesn't degrade app performance
5. **Data Protection**: User data remains intact through failure scenarios
6. **Accessibility**: Error states are accessible to all users
7. **Security**: No sensitive information exposed through error messages

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

These tests validate the existing error handling infrastructure:

- **BaseErrorBoundary** - Component-level error catching
- **RootErrorBoundary** - Application-level error handling  
- **Sentry Integration** - Error reporting and tracking
- **Redis/Upstash** - Distributed caching and rate limiting
- **Service Layer Pattern** - Clean separation of concerns
- **TanStack Query** - Server state management with error handling
- **Zustand** - UI state management during errors

The test suite ensures the "90% production-ready" status claimed in CLAUDE.md is accurate, with comprehensive error handling that maintains excellent user experience even during failures.
