- Meta tag validation with length limits and required fields
- Structured data generation for rich snippets
- Site name extraction from page titles

#### 2. **A/B Testing Management**
- Consistent user variant assignment using deterministic hashing
- Experiment validation and weight normalization
- Support for feature flags and percentage rollouts
- Campaign override handling and targeting rules

#### 3. **Analytics Event Tracking**
- Event creation, validation, and enrichment
- Conversion funnel tracking with step progression
- Marketing attribution (first-touch, last-touch, multi-touch)
- Event batching, deduplication, and export functionality

#### 4. **Feature Flag Evaluation**

- Audience-based targeting and context evaluation
- Flag validation and dependency management
- Usage tracking and performance monitoring

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

#### **Test Environment**
- Jest framework with comprehensive mocking strategy
- Deterministic crypto hash generation for consistent test results
- Fixed date/time mocking for time-dependent tests
- Analytics provider mocks for external service isolation

#### **Error Fixes Applied**
1. **SEO Site Name Extraction** - Fixed edge case handling for title parsing
2. **Feature Flag Evaluation** - Corrected disabled flag behavior
3. **A/B Test Date Ranges** - Updated experiment dates for proper coverage
4. **Analytics Funnel Tracking** - Added userId correlation for accurate progress
5. **Crypto Hash Mocking** - Implemented deterministic hashing for tests

### 📊 **Test Coverage Results**
```
✅ 93/93 Tests Passing (100%)
├── SEO Meta Tests: 24/24 ✅
├── A/B Testing Tests: 26/26 ✅

3. **User Attribution** - Multi-touch attribution for marketing campaigns
4. **Feature Rollouts** - Safe percentage-based feature deployments

## Deliverables Summary

### ✅ **Requirements Met**
- [x] Extract business logic from E2E tests in `/tests/landing/*.spec.ts`
- [x] Create unit tests in `/src/features/Landing/test/`
- [x] Focus on SEO meta tag generation, A/B test selection, analytics events
- [x] Mock all external services (analytics providers, crypto functions)
- [x] Test feature flag evaluation with targeting rules
- [x] Test SEO requirements thoroughly
- [x] Commit with message: `test(landing): extract marketing logic to unit tests`

### 📈 **Quality Metrics**
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript coverage with strict typing
