# Test Migration Summary

## Agent Assignments

### High Priority (Week 1)
- **A1 - Auth**: Security-critical authentication and session management
- **A5 - Infrastructure**: Error handling, resilience, and monitoring
- **A9 - Shared Services**: Foundation utilities used by all features

### Medium Priority (Week 2)
- **A2 - Bingo**: Core game logic and win detection
- **A3 - Community**: Moderation and user interactions
- **A4 - Play Area**: Game discovery and achievements
- **A7 - Settings**: User preferences and account management

### Low Priority (Week 3)
- **A6 - Landing**: SEO, analytics, and marketing
- **A8 - User Profile**: Stats and activity tracking

## Parallel Work Strategy

### Week 1
- A1, A5, and A9 work in parallel
- A9 creates shared test utilities
- A1 and A5 use utilities as they become available

### Week 2
- A2, A3, A4, and A7 work in parallel
- Depend on shared utilities from A9
- Can reuse patterns from A1 and A5

### Week 3
- A6 and A8 complete remaining migrations
- Focus on optimization and cleanup
- Ensure all E2E tests are simplified

## Success Metrics

1. **Test Execution Time**
   - Current: 15+ minutes for full E2E suite
   - Target: 3 minutes for unit + integration + simplified E2E

2. **Test Distribution**
   - Current: 100% E2E tests
   - Target: 70% unit, 20% integration, 10% E2E

3. **Coverage Goals**
   - Business logic: 90%+ unit test coverage
   - API endpoints: 100% integration test coverage
   - Critical paths: 100% E2E coverage

4. **Development Velocity**
   - Current: 45s feedback for logic changes
   - Target: 5s feedback for logic changes

## Coordination Points

1. **Shared Test Utilities** (A9 → All)
   - Mock factories
   - Test data builders
   - Common assertions
   - Test database utilities

2. **Pattern Documentation** (A1, A5 → Others)
   - Unit test patterns
   - Integration test patterns
   - Mock strategies
   - Performance testing

3. **E2E Test Reduction** (All → QA)
   - Identify tests to remove
   - Ensure coverage overlap
   - Update test documentation
   - Train team on new structure

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Maintain Test Coverage**
   - Don't remove E2E tests until unit tests pass
   - Run both suites in parallel initially
   - Monitor coverage metrics

2. **Avoid Duplication**
   - Regular sync between agents
   - Shared utility development
   - Pattern documentation

3. **Performance Regression**
   - Set up performance budgets
   - Monitor test execution time
   - Optimize slow tests

## Definition of Done

Each agent's work is complete when:
1. All business logic extracted to unit tests
2. Integration tests cover API boundaries
3. E2E tests simplified to user journeys only
4. Documentation updated
5. CI/CD pipeline updated
6. Team trained on new tests

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: High priority agents (A1, A5, A9)
- **Week 2**: Medium priority agents (A2, A3, A4, A7)
- **Week 3**: Low priority agents (A6, A8) + optimization
- **Week 4**: Buffer for completion and training

Total estimated time: 3-4 weeks with 9 parallel agents.
